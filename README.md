# PandaCount

Parsing DNA sequence by various means, based on an [original idea from the Rosalind Institure](http://rosalind.info/problems/dna/).

An exercise at the an Edinburgh Elixir meetup, at CodeClan/CodeBase on the 7th of November 2016.

* [PandaCount.DnaCount](lib/panda_count/dna_count.ex) illustrates counting with recursion and an accummulator.
* [PandaCount.DnaStream](lib/panda_count/dna_stream.ex) is an chance to try out the new [`Experimental.Flow`](https://hexdocs.pm/gen_stage/0.8.0/Experimental.Flow.html) in `gen_stage`.
